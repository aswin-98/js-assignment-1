     <h2>introduction of available Datatypes in JS</h2>

     <p><h4>The String Data Type</h4>
          The string data type is used to represent textual data. Strings are created using single or double quotes surrounding one or more characters.</p>
          <script>
               var a = "Let's have a cup of coffee."; // single quote inside double quotes
               var b = 'He said "Hello" and left.';  // double quotes inside single quotes
               var c = 'We\'ll never give up.';     // escaping single quote with backslash
          </script>
<hr>
<p><h4>The Number Data Type</h4>
     The number data type is used to represent positive or negative numbers with or without decimal place, or numbers written using exponential notation</p>
     <script>
          var a = 25;         // integer
          var b = 80.5;       // floating-point number
          var c = 4.25e+6;    // exponential notation, same as 4.25e6 or 4250000
          var d = 4.25e-6;    // exponential notation, same as 0.00000425
     </script>
<hr>
<p><h4>The Boolean Data Type</h4>
     The Boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is typically used to store values like yes (true) or no (false). </p>
     <script>
          var isReading = true;   // yes, I'm reading
          var isSleeping = false; // no, I'm not sleeping
     </script>
<hr>
<p><h4>The Undefined Data Type</h4>
     The undefined data type can only have one value-the special value undefined. If a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value, has the value undefined.</p>
     <script>
          var x;
          var y = "Hello World!";
        console.log(x);
        console.log(y);          
    </script>
<hr>
<p><h4>The Null Data Type</h4>
     This is another special data type that can have only one value-the null value. A null value means that there is no value. It is not equivalent to an empty string ("") or 0, it is simply nothing.
        A variable can be explicitly emptied of its current contents by assigning it the null value.</p>
    <script>
         var empty = null;
         console.log(empty);
 
         var stored= "Hi am JavaScript"
         console.log(stored); 
    </script>
    <hr>

<p><h4>The Object Data Type</h4>
     The object is a complex data type that allows you to store collections of data.
        An object contains properties, defined as a key-value pair. A property key (name) is always a string, but the value can be any data type, like strings, numbers, booleans, or complex data types like arrays, function and other objects.</p>    

        <script>
             var emptyObject = {};
     var computer = {
    "OS": "Windows 10",
    "RAM": "8 GB",
    "Hard disk":"500 GB"
     }
        </script>
