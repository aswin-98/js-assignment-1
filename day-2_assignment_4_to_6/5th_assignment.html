     <h3>difference between Var,Ler and Const </h3>
 <p>In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or const.</p>
 <script>
      var a=10;
       let b=20;
        const PI=3.14;
 </script>
<hr>
<p><b>Var: </b>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is limited to the “function” within which it is defined. If it is defined outside any function, the scope of the variable is global.
var is “function scoped”.</p>
<script>
      var a="LetsUpgrade";
  console.log(a);
</script>
<hr>
<p><b>let: </b>The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .</p>
<script>
     {
 let b="Javascript";
 console.log(b);
} 
</script>
<hr>

<p><b>const:</b> The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “const” is limited to the block defined by curly braces.</p>
<script>
{
 const a = [1,2,3];
 const b = {name: "hello"};

 a.push(4,5);     //the value of constant "a"
 b.name="World";  // the value of constant "b"
 
 console.log(a); 
 console.log(b);
